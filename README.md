# PRISMdata_reader
Contains a series of scripts that are easily manipulated to access the data user requires. The code can access preform computations, and vizualize data from the PRISM CLimatw Group.The data is in the form of gridded rasters over the entire US continent. There are multiple temporal scales but this code is intended for the monthly data available

#The Code
There are four .R documents each created for the use of manipulated previously downloaded raster files. They are specified to access data from particular directories so this aspect has to be changed personally for the user. Be sure to set the correct directory before using the programs.
